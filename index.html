Speed reading is a collection of reading methods which attempt to
increase rates of reading without greatly reducing comprehension or
retention. Methods include chunking and eliminating subvocalization.
Even though one's eyes fixate on every word and space during the
process of reading, speed reading can occur when the number of eye
pauses and duration of fixations are minimized. However, no
absolute distinct "normal" and "speed-reading" types of reading exist
in practice, since all readers use some of the techniques used in
speed reading (such as identifying words without focusing on each
letter, not sounding out all words, not sub-vocalizing some phrases,
or spending less time on some phrases than others, and skimming small
sections). Speed reading is characterized by an analysis of trade-offs
between measures of speed and comprehension, recognizing that
different types of reading call for different speed and comprehension
rates, and that those rates may be improved with practice. The many
available speed reading training programs include books, videos,
software, and seminars.
